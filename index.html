  <u><h3 id="About">About Me</h3></u>
  <p id="About">My name is Grassley Chen. I am a student at Brooklyn College.
    I have always been interested art and media. Growing up watching cartoons from PBS Kids, Cartoon Network and
  Vortex, along with reading graphic novels, served as my inspiration. I often find myself enjoying stories that depict a "darker" or more 
    "gritty" genre. If I felt like there were really well-choreographed and animated fight scenes in a piece of media, 9 times out of 10, 
    I would already be hooked. My favorite types of media growing up included Dragon Ball, the DC Injustice story, and the Artix Games. 
    Most of my stories are deeply inspired by these types of media. I often find myself maladaptive daydreaming of scenes where one of my OCs 
    experiences some severe tragedy. Tragic and dark narratives spark something in me, and I love being able to combine aspects of 
    visual arts and media to create what I wish there was more of! 

<p>Winter break of my Junior year in high school changed everything. I watched a show on Netflix that I have been putting off for
  a while due to a tight and busy schedule. It was time to watch <i>Arcane</i>. The number of things I can say about this glorious piece 
  of art will never end. From the animation, the voice acting, world building... but what captivated me the most was the writing. It was 
  perfect. The moment I finished the show, I immediately went for a rewatch and filled up a playlist on YouTube for video essays on good writing. 
  Nothing has inspired me to this level. I think beyond the writing, a key factor that made me love the show so much, was the genre
  and the type of plot. It was modern fantasy, dark, gritty, violent and told a story through my favorite trope. It was as if the creators of
  Arcane read my notebook and Google Docs of my personal fictional stories and said, "we gotchu." 
  <b>perfectly</b>. </p>

  <p>Recently, I've gotten into some content creation. I've been using the free editing tool <i>CapCut</i>(yes, it's
  because I'm broke) to enhance my videos. I have posted some videos on my YouTube channel and TikTok. I've only been dabbling in this new
  form of creation somewhat casually, but I absolutely love it! As an artist, I am always trying to think of ways to create, so finding 
  another way to do so through digitized content was inspiring! I definitely want to continue enhancing my knowledge in this medium of 
  creation and combine it with the other art forms that I already love! </p>
